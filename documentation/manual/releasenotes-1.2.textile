h1. Play 1.2 -- Release notes

You can read about the bugs fixed in Play 1.2 on the "road map page":http://www.playframework.org/roadmap/1.2. This page highlights the most important changes.

h2. Migrating from Play 1.1.x

Migrating from Play 1.1.x is pretty straightforward. There are no changes to the application layout, so your applications will run Play 1.2. However if you use any external modules in your application, you may have to use more recent versions that are compatible with Play 1.2. Check the corresponding module pages.

Some APIs have been removed in Play 1.2, after having been deprecated for a long time, but most of the public API is the same. If you have compilation errors that you donâ€™t know how to solve, ask on the Google group.
